const text = {
  1: "Every week counts for the woman trying to conceive and get pregnant! The first week of your pregnancy is technically not the first week of pregnancy, but the week of your last menstrual period (lmp). The due date is calculated as forty weeks from the first day of your last menstrual period, which means that the birth countdown actually begins about two weeks before the child has even been conceived, right around that month's menstrual period. However, every healthy pregnancy starts before the woman becomes physically pregnant, by parents mentally and physically preparing themselves for a baby, especially future moms.",
  2: "Welcome to the second week of your early pregnancy journey, which will be forty weeks long. 2 weeks pregnant is not much different than the first one in the row, at least in the sense that you are still not technically pregnant at 2 weeks pregnant, but the week is calculated according to the due date. However, that beautiful goal of a positive pregnancy test and a healthy pregnancy is very close, as the body prepares to ovulate during the second week of early pregnancy. If you are trying to conceive and you are looking to maximize your chances of getting pregnant, the second week of your pregnancy is the perfect time to go the extra mile and pay attention to your body's fertility signals, as well as spend some quality time with your partner.",
  3: "At week three, congratulations are due! You are officially pregnant! You will have to wait for a while for the test to show those two pink lines, but some changes are definitely in motion now. Apart from that little cluster of cells called embryo, which is soon to become your baby, some changes are also going on with the woman's body at 3 weeks pregnant.",
  4: "During 4 weeks pregnant, the little life you have created, in a form of fertilized egg implants, settles in the inner layer of the uterine wall, where it will continue to grow and develop over your term, which is the next thirty-six weeks. Right now, your growing baby is as big as a poppy seed! Week four of pregnancy is special because, apart from some other symptoms, it comes with the rise of the pregnancy hormone hCG, which is the main indicator of pregnancy used in the home pregnancy tests. This means that a home pregnancy test might be able to detect your early pregnancy during week four, and you will get a confirmation of your growing baby and baby's development!",
  5: "There is one thing that you are going to miss during 5 weeks pregnant, and it is your period! A missed period usually leads most women to take a pregnancy test to figure out whether they are pregnant or not, right around 5 weeks pregnant. Those two small pink lines can lead to many different emotions, from absolute happiness and excitement to fear. The baby inside you is way too small to feel at 5 weeks pregnant, but that does not mean that you will not start connecting to it, both physically and emotionally.",
  6: "When you are 6 weeks pregnant, the reality of the pregnancy is probably just setting in, especially if you have been trying for a while. The feelings at 6 weeks pregnant might be mixed; you are probably delighted, happy, confused, scared out of your mind… all at the same time. The fact is, your body and your baby are changing quickly, even if these changes are not visible on the outside. At 6 weeks pregnant, you are probably starting to feel your pregnancy hormones and hormonal changes at full force. Another great change is that the little baby inside of you is starting to form its organs at 6 weeks pregnant!",
  7: "Once you get into your seventh week of pregnancy, you are officially in the second month of your pregnancy, which is very exciting! It means that, at 7 weeks pregnant, it is only seven months until your baby gets here! Another fun fact is that, at 7 weeks pregnant, the embryo is ten thousand times bigger than it was when it first arrived in your uterus! You might not be noticing the changes on the outside at 7 weeks pregnant, but on the inside, your baby is growing very fast and generating new brain cells at a rate of 100 per minute.",
  8: "You are probably not showing at 8 weeks pregnant, but you probably feel pregnant. At 8 weeks pregnant, you are probably experiencing all of the specific symptoms that come with the first trimester of pregnancy, including morning sickness. In addition, your clothes are probably starting to become tighter and tighter, and your curiosity about the little baby inside of you is growing and growing as each day passes by. Things are in motion at 8 weeks pregnant, and you can expect more and more changes as each week of your pregnancy passes by.",
  9: "At 9 weeks pregnant, you probably feel like you have been sick or throwing up for ages now. You probably forgot what not being nauseous feels like and you are probably annoyed with the need for frequent urination. The truth is that your hormone human chorionic gonadotropin levels (hCG) are nearing or at their highest at 9 weeks pregnant, which causes all of the early pregnancy symptoms to be at their absolute peak. Some fun stuff waiting for you during week nine of pregnancy include severe mood swings, breast tenderness, nausea, heartburn, and constipation.",
  10: "Welcome to week ten of your pregnancy! The end of your 1st trimester is on the horizon, and you are inching closer and closer to it each day as you get through 10 weeks pregnant. The good news is that the trimester in front of you, which is the second one, is the most beloved one by many pregnant women since they report having more energy and all those uncomfortable early pregnancy symptoms fading away. 10 weeks pregnant is the point in your pregnancy where the baby bump becomes more noticeable to you and the people around you! The baby bump will be even more visible if you are expecting multiples or if this is not your first pregnancy rodeo. However, still not showing at 10 weeks pregnant is also completely normal too; women are different, and so are the babies inside them.",
  11: "Week eleven of your pregnancy is exciting because you are getting closer and closer to the end of the first trimester and the beginning of the second trimester, which is regarded as the best trimester for many pregnant women! At 11 weeks pregnant, you are in your first trimester, and you will experience many different changes in both you and the little baby inside you. At 11 weeks pregnant, the baby is looking more like a baby by developing some distinct human characteristics (such as toes and fingers), and the future mom is feeling more and more pregnant as each day goes by. While the symptoms of week ten will stick around during week eleven, some other ones will also appear at 11 weeks pregnant.",
  12: "At 12 weeks pregnant, so many new things are in motion, and your body is working hard to keep the baby inside you growing and growing! The mom-to-be is reaching the beginning of the second trimester slowly, which means that the crazy pregnancy hormones are likely to tone things down a bit and take the uncomfortable early pregnancy symptoms with them, hopefully. Many pregnant women and couples who are expecting a baby decide to wait for the beginning of the second trimester to announce the pregnancy to their friends and family. At 12 weeks pregnant, that point is slowly approaching, which is very exciting!",
  13: "Welcome to week thirteen of your pregnancy! Week thirteen is special because it marks the end of the first trimester, which means that, at 13 weeks pregnant, the first third of your pregnancy journey is already behind you. At 13 weeks pregnant, the mom-to-be is going through a lot of changes, but the little baby inside of you is going through a lot of changes as well. And there is so much to do! At 13 weeks pregnant, you will feel like a new woman, almost like you are turning the corner and starting a new era in your pregnancy. The first trimester, full of morning sickness, fatigue, and other issues, will be entirely behind you. You can expect a lot more ease in the second trimester!",
  14: "At 14 weeks pregnant, you have officially entered the second trimester of your pregnancy; congratulations! At 14 weeks pregnant, you are at month four of your pregnancy, and you only have five months left to go! Week fourteen will bring a lot of changes, such as feeling hungrier, less nauseous, and more energetic for mom-to-be, and getting chubbier by the day, sprouting some hair for the baby!",
  15: "At 15 weeks pregnant, you are in the second week of your second trimester, and it is a significant one. Week fifteen will bring some major changes, and the best way to deal with them is to get informed beforehand.",
  16: "At 16 weeks pregnant, you are officially in your fourth month of pregnancy and the second trimester of your pregnancy! Inside your belly, your baby is growing rapidly, and there are some physical changes you are experiencing as well. If you have not already raided maternity clothing stores, this pregnancy week is the perfect time to do so!",
  17: "At 17 weeks pregnant, your baby is getting bigger, gaining muscle, and putting on some fat. Meanwhile, the mom-to-be is probably noticing some symptoms reflecting the changes going on on the inside. At 17 weeks pregnant, you are four months and one week pregnant, which means there are 23 more weeks to go until the baby arrives.",
  18: "During week 18 of pregnancy, the baby is going to begin yawning and having hiccups, and the mom's pregnancy belly is becoming more and more evident as each day goes by.",
  19: "At nineteen weeks pregnant, you enter pregnancy month five, and you are in the second trimester of your pregnancy. During the nineteenth pregnancy week and the upcoming weeks, you will experience some exciting pregnancy milestones, such as feeling the baby's first kicks for the first time and having the 20-week ultrasound or anatomy scan. During this scan, you will get to meet your baby up close.",
  20: "You are already at the halfway point of your pregnancy at twenty weeks along, and the excitement to meet your baby is probably growing by the day.",
  21: "As you enter into the second half of your pregnancy journey, you will be greeted by a period of rapid growth and many changes happening in a short period. The first trimester moved pretty slowly, but the second trimester will take you by a storm through many symptoms and changes. Inside your belly, your baby is getting ready for life outside the womb by developing essential skills, including breathing, sucking, and controlling limb movements.",
  22: "You are more than halfway through your pregnancy journey at twenty-two weeks pregnant, and you are inching closer and closer to meeting your baby.",
  23: "During the twenty-third pregnancy week, your baby is about to enter a major growth spurt, which will make it almost double in size over the next month, and continue in the third trimester. On the other hand, the mom-to-be is probably starting to deal with a “pregnancy brain,” which is used to describe the feeling of fogginess, confusion, and haziness.",
  24: "At twenty-four weeks pregnant, your baby is growing and getting stronger and stronger as each day passes by! It is moving more and more by each day, and you are probably feeling these moves in the form of pokes and kicks inside your belly. You can expect these movements to become more frequent during this week and in the upcoming weeks.",
  25: "Once you step into your twenty-fifth pregnancy week, you are inching closer and closer to the end of your second trimester, and you are getting closer and closer to the third trimester and delivery! You probably feel like time is flying you by! At 25 weeks pregnant, you are about months and two weeks along, and it won't be long before your little bundle of joy comes into the world. Week twenty-five of pregnancy will bring many changes, both for you and your baby, many connected with the hormonal changes you are going through.",
  26: "Slowly but surely, you are rounding the corner of the second trimester at 26 weeks pregnant, and the third trimester is inching closer and closer by the day! Pregnancy week twenty-six will bring many changes for you and your baby; read on to find out all about them.",
  27: "At 27 weeks pregnant, you are officially at your final week of the second trimester, congratulations! The last third of pregnancy, which is the third trimester, is right in front of you, and greeting your baby is closer than ever.",
  28: "Welcome to the third trimester! Week twenty-eight of your pregnancy starts a new and final chapter before you greet your baby.",
  29: "At 29 weeks pregnant, your baby is busy gaining fat and muscle and strengthening its little bones. Meanwhile, during the 29th pregnancy week, the future mom may be feeling extra tired and bigger by the hour.",
  30: "At 30 weeks pregnant, your baby is still developing and focusing on weight gain more than ever. The baby is getting bigger by the day, and the changes are visible week by week. Meanwhile, the future mom is going through some changes too, and slowly adapting to all the news that the third trimester brings.",
  31: "At thirty-one weeks pregnant, you are in the third trimester, and you are probably getting antsier and antsier about the baby's arrival, and you cannot wait to meet your little sunshine! But, on the other hand, your baby is very active inside your belly, and its brain is getting increasingly more active as each day passes.",
  32: "Welcome to thirty-two weeks pregnant! At 32 weeks pregnant, you are in the third trimester, and you and your baby are preparing for your first meet, even though it might seem so far in the future! Thirty-two weeks pregnant usually means a lot of planning, dealing with end-of-pregnancy to-dos, and daydreaming about meeting your baby soon.",
  33: "Welcome to 33 weeks pregnant! At this stage of your third trimester, your baby is developing their sucking and swallowing skills practicing their breathing patterns and muscle movements. It will be just a while before the baby arrives! Meanwhile, the bodies of the moms-to-be are working very hard to finish the final stages of pregnancy and prepare for childbirth, which will come by the end of the third trimester.",
  34: "Isn't it amazing how time flies? Just yesterday, you were looking at your positive pregnancy test in awe, and in a blink of an eye, your baby can now hear your voice and listen to your conversations at the thirty-fourth pregnancy week and the third trimester is coming close to its end! You probably feel happy and excited but also very nervous; pregnancy can be pretty nerve-wracking at such a late stage, since the baby's arrival is so close now.",
  35: "At the 35-weeks pregnant, you are wrapping up month eight, and there is only one month left to go until your baby comes and you finally get to meet them.",
  36: "Welcome to thirty-six weeks pregnant! Believe it or not, being 36 weeks pregnant means that you have officially entered month nine. Many refer to pregnancy as a nine-month-long ordeal, but the reality is that pregnancy often lasts about ten months, sometimes even longer! The due date is still a few weeks away.",
  37: "Welcome to thirty-seven weeks pregnant! At 37 weeks pregnant, your baby is finally and officially considered “early term” and no longer pre-term, which is fantastic! Right now, your baby is putting the finishing touches on perfecting its vital skills, such as swallowing and sucking (which will be much-needed once the baby arrives), while your body may be giving you signs that it is getting ready for labor and delivery.",
  38: "Welcome to 38 weeks pregnant! Your baby is nearing complete maturity and full-term at the thirty-eighth week of your pregnancy. As the baby moves lower into your pelvis, you might be breathing and moving a bit easier than before, thanks to a reduced upper abdominal pressure. However, getting up from the sofa is more complicated than ever.",
  39: "Welcome to 39 weeks pregnant! Your baby has finally reached full term, and you are probably freaking out because the baby's arrival is so close, and there are so many more things to do! You are also most likely scared, especially if this is your first pregnancy journey. The best way to overcome these fears is to face them, get familiar with the scenarios, and get ready and prepared!",
  40: "Welcome to your final week of pregnancy! Well, not really! Week forty means you are full-term, but carrying the baby for one or two extra weeks is not uncommon, and many future moms experience this.Week 40 can be mentally difficult, thanks to constant wondering when the baby will decide to come out and meet you finally.",
